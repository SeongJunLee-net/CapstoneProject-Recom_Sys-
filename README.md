# Capstone Project Recommenadtion System
## ðŸ“¢ Repository Explanation
I developed a mutual recommendation system between students and professionals for my graduation project in the Computer Science department at Incheon National University. To achieve this, I created dummy users based on real open data, and then vectorized the tabular data containing dummy user information using RoBERTa and prompt engineering. Afterward, I trained a simple deep learning model on this data, analyzing the importance of each feature and building the final recommendation system.
